# Introduction
FSM support of JCUnit (FSM/JCUnit) offers you automated 'Model-based testing' functionality
for Java classes. 
The basic idea is to let users model their SUT(System under test)s as finite state 
machines and the other things should be taken care of by computers.

Following is a diagram picked up from a Wikipedia article about [Model-based testing][0] that
illustrates a pipeline of "Offline test case generation". Activities executed by 
JCUnit and artifacts generated by JCUnits are annotated in it.  

Users are supposed to provide 3 types of information. Model, test requirements,
and IXIT, which stands for "Implementation extra information".

Author recommends you to follow steps described in this document (especially
the first section of it) with your hands to understand ideas behind the product. 
The procedures might look complicated initially, but once you try it, you should 
notice it's designed intuitive and straightforward (at least the author tried very 
hard to make it intuitive and straightforward).

# Modeling FSM
Let's model your FSM. If you are creating a finite state machine which has two actions, 
```cook``` and ```eat```, and only after ```cook``` is done, the machine can ```eat``` 
a thing, a state transition diagram for it would be like following.

[FIG.1] "Simplest finite state machine"
```
                               
                                +--+
                                |  |eat 
                                |  V 
    +-----+                   +------+
    |  I  |------------------>|COOKED|
    +-----+       cook        +------+


```

The machine has 2 states, which are ```I``` and ```COOKED```. ```I``` is the initial 
state in which the machine is right after its creation. And ```COOKED``` is the 
state to which it moves after an action ```cook``` is performed.

If you are going to implement this state machine as a Java program, it might become like this,

[CODE.1] "Implementation of Figure 1 - SUT with a bug."
```java
    
    public class FSMonster {
        boolean cooked = false;
        public void cook() {
            // Don't we need to check the value of cooked before assigning?
            this.cooked = true;
        }
       
        public void eat() {
            if (this.cooked) {
                System.out.println("Yummy!");
            } else {
                throw new IllegalStateException("Not yet cooked!");
            }
        }
    }

```

What should happen if ```cook``` is attempted when the machine is already in ```COOKED``` state?
Unless explicitly described in the state machine diagram, shouldn't it be rejected?

Yes, it should be rejected. This is an intentional bug for explanation of "FSM support
feature". This bug itself might be easy to be found, but if you have some experience in
software developments, finding/debugging this sort of bugs is sometimes a time consuming,
cumbersome, boring task.

How to detect this sort of bugs in your SUT using "FSM feature" of JCUnit will be
discussed later in this document.


## Listing states and actions
Let's go back to the diagram [FIG.1], as we already saw, there are 2 states and 2 actions,

* States: ```I```, ```COOKED```
* Actions(Input symbols): ```cook```, ```eat```

In JCUnit, to model a finite state machine, you need to implement ```FSMSpec<SUT>```
interface. ```SUT``` is a class name of your software under test.
And inside your implementation, you will use a few annotations, ```@StateSpec```, ```@ActionSpec```,
and ```@ParametersSpec```. Only first two will be necessary to model the machine 
and ```@ParametersSpec``` will be discussed later to model an action with parameters.

```public static final``` fields annotated with ```@StateSpec``` will be treated 
as states by JCUnit.
Among those fields, a field named ```I``` (capital I) has a special semantics, where
it is considered 'initial state' of the finite state machine. And you must define
it always.

Methods annotated with ```@ActionSpec``` are treated as definitions of actions.
They must return ```Expectation<SUT>``` and their first parameter must be ```Expectation.Builder<SUT>``` 
always.
JCUnit validates the types and complain if they do not meet the requirements.

Following is a skeleton of the spec of the FSM.


[CODE.2] "Model in JCUnit of Figure 1 - Skeleton"
```java

    public enum Spec implements FSMSpec<FSMonster> {
      @StateSpec I {
        ... },
      @StateSpec COOKED {
        ... },; 

      @ActionSpec public Expectation<FSMonster> cook(Expectation.Builder<FSMonster> b) {
        ... }
      @ActionSpec public Expectation<FSMonster> eat(Expectation.Builder<FSMonster> b) {
        ... }
    }

```

## Modeling states and actions
Mathematically, a (deterministic) finite state machine (transducer) can be formalized 
as follows

```

      Sigma: input symbols
      Gamma: output symbols
      S:     states
      s0:    initial state
      delta: state transition function. delta: S x Sigma -> S
      omega: output function. omega: S x Sigma -> Gamma (Mealy machine)

```

We have already created an ```enum``` class, ```Spec```. This so far modeled ```S```,
```s0```, and ```Sigma```.
```S``` is represented by enum fields annotated with ```@StateSpec```. ```s0``` 
is ```I```. ```Sigma``` is modeled as methods annotated with ```@ActionSpec```.

In this sub section, how we can model the rest of them, which are ```Gamma```,
  ```delta```, and ```omega``` will be discussed.

About ```Gamma```, since JCUnit is a software product to test Java programmes,
we need to consider exceptions as output symbols not only regular returned values.

And about ```Sigma```, since methods in Java have parameters, we somehow need to 
take them into considerations. This topic will also be covered in this sub-section.

### Modeling states
At first, FSMSpec<SUT> interface requires you to implement ```check(SUT): boolean``` 
method. The method is responsible for checking if the SUT is in the specified state.
Suppose that ```FSMonster``` has a method ```isReady()```, which returns true iff it's
in ```COOKED``` state, you can do following

[CODE.3] "Implementing states"
```java

    public enum Spec implements FSMSpec<FSMonster> {
      @StateSpec I {
        @Override public boolean check(FSMonster fsm) {
          return !fsm.isReady();
        }
      },
      @StateSpec COOKED {
        @Override public boolean check(FSMonster fsm) {
          return fsm.isReady();
        }
      },;
      ...
    }

```

But this is actually a part of 'IXIT', which should be discussed in [a later section](#Running tests).
For now, define it at one level upper and let it return ```true``` always. 


```java

    public enum Spec implements FSMSpec<FSMonster> {
      ...
      public boolean check(FSMonster fsm) {
          return true.
      }
    }

```

## Modeling actions
As we already mentioned, if it is not explicitly allowed in a state machine diagram,
we should think that an operation isn't allowed.

In the figure 1., operations allowed are 'cook' on state 'I', and 'eat' on 'COOKED'.
Therefore, we should test if 'eat' on 'I' and 'cook' on 'COOKED' result in errors.

[FIG.2] "Simplest finite state machine"
```
                               
                                +--+
                                |  |eat 
                                |  V 
    +-----+                   +------+
    |  I  |------------------>|COOKED|
    +-----+       cook        +------+


```

The idea that unless it is explicitly allowed, it should result in an error' can
be expressed in a following way.

[CODE.4] "Implementing actions (1) Defining default behaviours"
```java

    public enum Spec implements FSMSpec<FSMonster> {
      ...
      @ActionSpec public Expectation<FSMonster> cook(Expectation.Builder<FSMonster> b) {
        return b.invalid().build();
      }
      @ActionSpec public Expectation<FSMonster> eat(Expectation.Builder<FSMonster> b) {
        return b.invalid().build();
      }
    }
    
```

The parameter ```b``` is an instance of ```Expectation.Builder<SUT>```, by which
you can instantiate ```Expectation<SUT>```. In this case you are creating an expectation
where this operation should fail (```invalid```).

And then you will override these methods in the states accordingly.

[CODE.5] "Implementing actions (2) Defining state specific behaviours"
```java

    public enum Spec implements FSMSpec<FSMonster> {
      @StateSpec I {
        @Override public Expectation<FSMonster> cook(Expectation.Builder<FSMonster> b) {
          return b.valid(COOKED).build();
        }
      },
      @StateSpec COOKED {
        @Override public Expectation<FSMonster> eat(Expectation.Builder<FSMonster> b) {
          return b.valid(COOKED).build();
        }
      },;
     
      @ActionSpec public Expectation<FSMonster> cook(Expectation.Builder<FSMonster> b) {
        return b.invalid().build();
      }
      @ActionSpec public Expectation<FSMonster> eat(Expectation.Builder<FSMonster> b) {
        return b.invalid().build();
      }
      @Override public boolean check(FlyingSpaghettiMonster fsm) {
        return true;
      }
    }

```

### Testing values returned by methods
In the example above, we are only able to test SUT's states. But methods can return 
values. And they must be tested. 

To test a returned value by a method, you need to describe your expectation for SUT.
You can do it by giving it to ```Expectation.Builder```.

If a method ```cook()``` of ```FSMonster``` should be returning a string ```"Cooking spaghetti"```,
then you can do this.

```java


    public enum Spec implements FSMSpec<FSMonster> {
      @StateSpec I {
        ...
        @Override public Expectation<FSMonster> cook(Expectation.Builder<FSMonster> b) {
          return b.valid(COOKED, CoreMatchers.startsWith("Cooking")).build();
        }
      },
      ...

```

The method ```valid(FSMSpec<SUT>, Matcher)``` of the builder sets expected status 
of the SUT and a condition to be satisfied by the value returned by the method ```cook``` of SUT,
 in this example ```FSMonster```.
The ```Matcher``` and ```CoreMatchers``` in this example are from ```org.hamcrest``` 
library, which is used in JUnit itself.

### About the finite state machine model we are using
As you may noticed, you can test a method which returns a different value when the
state machine is in a different state by overriding ```@ActionSpec``` annotated
method differently in states.

```java


    public enum Spec implements FSMSpec<FSMonster> {
      @StateSpec I {
        ...
        @Override public Expectation<FSMonster> cook(Expectation.Builder<FSMonster> b) {
          return b.valid(COOKED, CoreMatchers.startsWith("Cooking a dish")).build();
        }
      },
      @StateSpec COOKED {
        ...
        @Override public Expectation<FSMonster> cook(Expectation.Builder<FSMonster> b) {
          return b.valid(COOKED, CoreMatchers.startsWith("Cooking another dish")).build();
        }
      },
      ...

```

This is one sort of transducers called 'Mealy machine'. Its mathematical model can be
formalized as follows.

```

      Sigma: input symbols
      Gamma: output symbols
      S:     states
      s0:    initial state
      delta: state transition function. delta: S x Sigma -> S
      omega: output function. omega: S x Sigma -> Gamma (Mealy machine)
```

You can refer to Wikipedia articles for definitions of the models ([Mealy Machine][1]
and [Finite state transducer][2]).

## Annotations to model FSM
Following is a matrix that summarizes specifications of annotations used to model
FSMs.

| Annotation      | Target  | Modifiers           | Type                   |
| --------------- |:-------:|:------------------- |:----------------------:|
| @StateSpec      | Field   | public static final | Enclosing class        |
| @ActionSpec     | Method  | public              | Expectation&lt;SUT&gt; |
| @ParametersSpec | Field   | public static final | Parameters             |

A list of behaviours of those annotations follows. 

* **```@StateSpec```**: Enclosing class of a field annotated by this must implement
an interface ```FSMSpec<SUT>```. If you want to define a behaviour of an action 
which can be seen on a specific state, you can define a method (which is defined
in the enclosing class and annotated with ```@ActionSpec```)
* **```@ActionSpec```**: The name of the method must be the same as the name of
the method you are going to model by it. The first parameter must be ```Expectation.Builder<SUT>```.
And the rest of the parameters must exactly be the same as ones of the method 
to be tested in SUT.
* **```@ParametersSpec```**: A field annotated with this defines arguments given 
to a method which has the same name as it. The first argument will be picked up from
 the first array,  the second argument will be from the second array.
This manner will be followed to the last element, respectively.

### Testing a method with parameters
Methods have parameters. JCUnit has another annotation ```@ParametersSpec``` to define 
arguments given to actions that represent methods.

```
                               
                                +--+
                                |  |eat 
                                |  V 
    +-----+                   +------+
    |  I  |------------------>|COOKED|
    +-----+ cook(pasta,sauce) +------+


```

If a method ```cook``` has 2 parameters ```pasta``` and ```sauce```, they can be 
modeled as following.

```java

    public enum Spec implements FSMSpec<FSMonster> {
      @StateSpec I {...},
      @StateSpec COOKED {...},;
    
      @ActionSpec public Expectation<FSMonster> cook(Expectation.Builder<FSMonster> b,
          String pasta,
          String sauce) { ... }
      @ParametersSpec
      public static final Parameters cook = new Parameters.Builder(Object[][] {
          { "spaghetti", "spaghettini", "penne" },
          { "peperoncino", "carbonara", "meat sauce" },
      }).build();
      @ActionSpec public Expectation<FSMonster> eat(Expectation.Builder<FSMonster> b) {
        ... }
    }

```

You can define arguments that should be given to a method ```cook``` as a public
static final field whose name is the same as the method.

```java

      @ParametersSpec public static final Parameters cook = new Parameters.Builder(new Object[][] {
          { "spaghetti", "spaghettini", "penne" },
          { "peperoncino", "carbonara", "meat sauce" },
      }).build();

```

The type of the argument given to the constructer must be ```Object[][]```. And the first element of it should
be an array each of whose elements will be given to the method ```cook``` as its
first argument. Of course the rest of the array will be treated in the same manner.

i.e., for the method ```cook(String,String)```, one of ```{ "spaghetti", "spaghettini", "penne" }```,
e.g., ```penne``` will be picked up and given to ```cook```'s first argument.
For the second parameter, one of ```{ "peperoncino", "carbonara", "meat sauce" }```,
e.g., ```meat sauce``` will be picked up and used as ```cook```'s second parameter.

JCUnit will automatically generates combinations of actual arguments from ```@ParametersSpec```.
Probably you might get concerned if a method has only several parameters each of which
has only several possible values, it results in a thousands of test cases.
But it will not happen usually, because JCUnit applies all-pair techniques here.
The detail will be discussed as a part of explanation for how you can describe 
"test requirements" in JCUnit.

### Testing a method with parameters and their constraints

Probably you want to define a topLevelConstraint for the parameters you give to an action.
It can be done by doing below. 

```java

      @ParametersSpec public static final Parameters cook = new Parameters.Builder(new Object[][] {
          { "spaghetti", "spaghettini", "penne" },
          { "peperoncino", "carbonara", "meat sauce" },
      }).setConstraintManager(
        new ConstraintManagerBase() {
          @Override
          public boolean check(Tuple tuple) throws UndefinedSymbol {
            String pasta = (String)tuple.get("p0");
            String sauce = (String)tuple.get("p1");
            if ("penne".equals(pasta) && "carbonara".equals(sauce)) return false;
            return true;
          }
        }      
      ).build();

```

This example precludes a test case for "penne carbonara" which doesn't sound very 
tasty from the test suite to be generated.
```p0``` and ```p1``` are parameter names assigned to factors you defined.
 
Or you can do below to do the same thing.
 
```java

      @ParametersSpec public static final Parameters cook = new Parameters.Builder()
      .add("pasta", "spaghettini", "penne" )
      .add("sauce", "peperoncino", "carbonara", "meat sauce" )
      .setConstraintManager(
        new ConstraintManagerBase() {
          @Override
          public boolean check(Tuple tuple) throws UndefinedSymbol {
            if ("penne".equals(tuple.get("pasta")) && "carbonara".equals(tuple.get("sauce"))) 
              return false;
            return true;
          }
      })      
      .build();
```

One thing you should be careful here is the names of factor are not associated with
parameter variable names of an action method.

That is, if you do following 

```java


      @ParametersSpec public static final Parameters cook = new Parameters.Builder()
      .add("sauce", "peperoncino", "carbonara", "meat sauce" )
      .add("pasta", "spaghettini", "penne" )
      .setConstraintManager(
        new ConstraintManagerBase() {
          @Override
          public boolean check(Tuple tuple) throws UndefinedSymbol {
            if ("penne".equals(tuple.get("pasta")) && "carbonara".equals(tuple.get("sauce"))) 
              return false;
            return true;
          }
      })      
      .build();

    @ActionSpec
    public Expectation<FSMonster> cook(Expectation.Builder<FSMonster> b, String pasta, String sauce) {
      return b.invalid().build();
    }

```

Values assigned to ```pasta``` and ```sauce``` will be skewed. 
```pasta``` will be assigned one of "peperoncino", "carbonara", or "meat sauce".
And ```sauce``` will be assigned one of "spaghetti" or "penne".

### Testing exceptions thrown by methods
Same as returned values, we want to test if a method is throwing an appropriate 
exception. You can do it by writing code as follows,

```java

    public enum Spec implements FSMSpec<FSMonster> {
      @StateSpec I {
        ...
        @Override public Expectation<FSMonster> cook(Expectation.Builder<FSMonster> b) {
          return b.invalid(NullPointerException.class).build();
        }
      },
      ...

```

You can even test if the SUT is in intended state after an exception is thrown.

```java

    public enum Spec implements FSMSpec<FSMonster> {
      @StateSpec I {
        ...
        @Override public Expectation<FSMonster> cook(Expectation.Builder<FSMonster> b) {
          return b.invalid(I, NullPointerException.class).build();
        }
      },
      ...

```

In the example above, JCUnit will test if the method ```cook``` throws ```NullPointerException```
and then test if the SUT (```FSMonster``` object) is in state ```I```.

# Running tests
Now we have modeled the FSM to be tested. Let's generate tests and run them.
If we go back to the diagram in the introduction ([FIG.0]), what we need to do 
now is to define 'test requirements'(2) and 'IXIT'(3).
  In this section we will first discuss how to define 'IXIT' and then move to 
'test requirements' because FSM/JCUnit has its defaults for 'test requirements'
and users do not need to pay attention to them unless they want to. 

## IXIT
Other Model-based testing solutions, e.g., [ModelJUnit][6] and [GraphWalker][8],
usually require users to implement adapters to talk to their SUTs.
FSM/JCUnit, since it automatically determines a method to be executed in SUT, which 
is assumed to be a Java object, based on an action's name and its signature in model 
side, users do not need to write adapters almost at all.

The only thing a user needs to do in order to run the generated test suite is
to call a method ```FSMUtils.perform```. The procedure is straightforward and
discussed in this subsection. See [Performing a story] chapter. The author believes 
this characteristic makes it a lot easiew to start trying Model-based testing with 
FSM/JCUnit.

That being said, implementing ```check(SUT)`` method in each state in the model
 will be very helpful for some reasons. The background and how to implement the
  method will be discussed in a chapter [Implementing check method].
 

### Performing a story
Let JCUnit know a field to store information about what path on FSM diagram should 
be executed.  

```java

    @FactorField(levelsProvider = FSMLevelsProvider.class)
    public Story<FSMonster, Spec> main;
  
```

```Spec``` is the (enum) class that models our FSM in the previous section.
And ```FSMonster``` is the class of our SUT.
You don't need to initialize this field by yourself, JCUnit will do it for you.

A factor field whose ```levelsProvider``` is ```FSMLevelsProvider``` is marked
FSM field by FSM/JCUnit and must be typed with ```Story<SUT, SPEC>``` where 
```SPEC``` is a spec class that you defined for the SUT ```FSMonster``` in the
previous section.

If a test class has one or more FSM fields, FSM/JCUnit feature will be activated.  
As other regular factors, the field must be public instance member.

In [the next section](#Inside FSM/JCUnit), internal structure of ```Story<SUT, SPEC>```
 object will be discussed in detail but for now you can consider it is just an object
that stores a sequence of events (methods) and expected states after they are given
to the FSM.

Now you can perform the story you have declared in the test class by just writing 
following code.

```java

    @Test
    public void test() throws Throwable {
      FSMonster sut = new FSMonster();
      FSMUtils.performStory(this, "main", sut);
    }
    
```


### Implementing check method
If there is not an easy (and safe) way to check it, simply you can return ```true```
always like following.

```java

    public enum Spec implements FSMSpec<FSMonster> {
      ...
      public boolean check(FSMonster fsm) {
          return true.
      }
    }

```

But from a debugging perspective, defining ```check(SUT)``` method in each state
as much as possible is a very good idea. 


```java

    public enum Spec implements FSMSpec<FSMonster> {
      @StateSpec I {
        @Override public boolean check(FlyingSpaghettiMonster fsm) {
          return !fsm.isReady();
        }
      },
      @StateSpec COOKED {
        @Override public boolean check(FlyingSpaghettiMonster fsm) {
          return fsm.isReady();
        }
      },;
      ...
    }

```

FSM/JCUnit makes sure if the method ```check(SUT)``` returns ```true``` whenever it
 performs a scenario.
 Since even if it doesn't check it, some expectation for returned values or exceptions 
would be broken later on in case your SUT has a bug, it is not mandatory to implement 
the method. 
But you probably want to know from what point SUT's internal state becomes different 
from the expected one as immediately as possible. Otherwise, you will need to figure 
out what really happened to the SUT, e.g., oh the returned value became unexpected 
from this point on. This would mean some internal information of my FSM was broken 
before this action but this action itself doesn't modify the object's state. Then 
let's go back to even one previous before it... 

On the other hand, without making sure the SUT is in expected state, should we 
really return ```true```?
Yes, it's inevitable at least in some cases.

If the SUT has ```getState()```, it would be good to write something like following,

```java

    @StateSpec I {
      @Override public boolean check(FlyingSpaghettiMonster fsm) {
        return "Initial".equals(fsm.getState().getName());
      }
    },
    @StateSpec COOKED {
      @Override public boolean check(FlyingSpaghettiMonster fsm) {
        return "Cooked".equals(fsm.getState().getName());
      }
    },;

```

But it is not necessarily the case always, a developer might not draw or might not
be able to draw state machine diagram for some reasons, you might be testing a 
class someone you don't know, etc. 
And more importantly, the FSM we modeled first [FIG.1] is independent of its actual 
implementation. Even if "getState()" method is provided, is the method really giving 
a correct state always? Isn't it what we are very testing?
If it is giving a state different from expectation, the SUT might be actually
in wrong state. Or it might be a bug where it is not giving a correct state. Either
way, we can say that it's a bug. Therefore, it's a good idea to check if the returned
state is correct.
But even if it is giving an expected state, it might be just deceiving us by a bug. 
Thus, what we can/should do here is to check SUT's state if it violates any known 
constraints derived from its other behaviours. In our example above, it is the value 
returned by ```isReady``` method.

## Test requirements
In this subsection, how test requirements, e.g., number of test cases in a test 
suite to be generated, to what extent paths on a SUT's FSM will be covered, etc.,
can be configured in JCUnit will be discussed.

### Switch coverage
In order to test FSMs, state coverage and transition coverage have been widely used[7](pp.150).
But it easy to come up with a bug which cannot be detected by test suite which make
both of them 100%. E.g., on a certain transition, some internal variable gets broken and
FSM reaches a state A. Later on the broken variable will be used and the SUT malfunctions. 
If there is another transition that makes our FSM's state A, the bug will possibly not 
be detected.  

A Japanese book [ソフトウェアテスト技法ドリル(Drills for software testing techniques)][3]
discusses this issue and they introduce an idea called 'switch coverage' (pp. 149).

If all the possible 2 adjacent transitions are covered, it will be called "1 switch coverage",
because in between those 2 transitions there is 1 state (switch). Similarly, "2 switch coverage"
 is defined that all the possible 3 successive transitions need to be covered.

But obviously the number of test cases would very quickly explode as N of "N-switch coverage"
increases.

And even worse, FSM/JCUnit considers two same actions which have different sets of 
arguments as two different transitions. This makes the number of transitions very 
big.

To balance those 2 requirements, which are switch coverage and number of test cases,
you can use some parameters. 

To tune switch coverage, you can configure number of switches through ```FSMLevelsProvider```'s 
parameter.
And for the other, you can configure tuple generation algorithms and their parameters.

### Number of switches

You can specify a number of switches through ```providerParams```.

```java

    @FactorField(levelsProvider = FSMLevelsProvider.class, providerParams = { @Param("2") })
    public Story<FSMonster, Spec> main;
  
```

Shortly to say, if you specify "2" for this parameter, it means 3 actions (at least) 
will be executed from a state chosen by FSM/JCUnit as a starting point in a test 
case. Because during the sequence 2 states are passed through.

By applying combinatorial method to a state machine, FSM/JCUnit generates
 a test suite with relatively a small (manageable) number. And this means not all
the possible paths whose length are the same as the number specified by this
parameter are actually executed unless you are giving the same number as a number
of all the factors FSM/JCUnit internally creates. 

For more details, refer to [Inside FSM/JCUnit](#Inside FSM/JCUnit) section.

### TupleGenerators
In this chapter, a few built-in tuple generators of JCUnit and its characteristics
 when you use them with FSM feature will be discussed.

#### IPO2TupleGenerator
```IPO2TupleGenerator``` is a default of FSM/JCUnit. And by changing its parameter,
you can control the balance between test strength and test suite size.


Following is an example to give 3 instead of default(2) to ```IPO2TupleGenerator```.

```java

      @RunWith(JCUnit.class)
      @TupleGeneration(
          generator = @Generator(value = IPO2TupleGenerator.class, params = @Param("3"))
      )
      public static class TestClass3 {
        ...
      }
```

But this increases number of test cases and test generation time.


#### RandomTupleGenerator
 All-pair (or t-wise) test generation can be very time consuming process.
 Some times probably you want to test your SUT more quickly even if you sacrifice
coverage on your FSM.
 In such a situation, you can configure your test class to use ```RandomTupleGenerator```
instead of ```IPO2TupleGenerator```, which is used by default.

```java

    @RunWith(JCUnit.class)
    @TupleGeneration(
        generator = @Generator(value = RandomTupleGenerator.class, params = {@Param("100"), @Param("1")})
    )
    public static class TestClass1 extends TestClass {
    }
```

 As shown, you can control the number of test cases in a suite explicitly (100 in 
this example).

# Reviewing reports
When you run a test, JCUnit will generate a report as follows.

```

     1:Starting(primary#setUp):ScenarioSequence:[I#cook(spaghettini,carbonara)]
     2:  Running(primary#setUp):I#cook(spaghettini,carbonara) expecting status of 'primary' is 'COOKED' and a string starting with "Cooking" is returned
     3:  Passed(primary#setUp)
     4:End(primary#setUp)
     5:Starting(primary#main):ScenarioSequence:[COOKED#cook(spaghetti,peperoncino),COOKED#eat()]
     6:  Running(primary#main):COOKED#cook(spaghetti,peperoncino) expecting status of 'primary' is 'COOKED' and a string starting with "Cooking" is returned
     7:  Passed(primary#main)
     8:  Running(primary#main):COOKED#eat() expecting status of 'main' is 'COOKED' and a string containing "yummy" is returned
     9:  Passed(primary#main)
    10:End(primary#main)
```

This report is generated from a test suite for a slightly different FSM from the
 one we have used. Following is the diagram that describes the state machine.
 
```
                               
                                +--+
                                |  |eat 
                                |  V 
    +-----+                   +------+
    |  I  |------------------>|COOKED|
    +-----+ cook(pasta,sauce) +------+
                                |  A
                                |  |cook(pasta,sauce)
                                +--+


```
The difference is that you can perform ```cook(pasta,sauce)``` action even if you
are already in ```COOKED``` state.

In this section, it will be discussed how you can read this report.

## setUp and main
As it will be explained later, a story comprises "setUp" scenario sequence and "main" 
 scenario sequence.
"main" is a test case itself which defines what should be done and in what order.
On the other had, "setUp" ensures the SUT to be in the first state from which
"main" scenario sequence starts.

Let's take a look at the first line of the report. It says

```

     1:Starting(primary#setUp):ScenarioSequence:[I#cook(spaghettini,carbonara)]
```

"primary" is a name of a FSM (story) to be tested. And 'setUp' shows that this line
is reporting an activity of "setUp" scenario sequence. Then the following scenario
sequence will be executed.
 According to this line, the sequence only contains one scenario. It performs an 
action ```cook``` with arguements ```"spaghetti"``` and ```"carbonara"```.
 This procedure is necessary because the "main" scenario sequence starts with ```cooked```
state as you see following.

```

     5:Starting(primary#main):ScenarioSequence:[COOKED#cook(spaghetti,peperoncino),COOKED#eat()]
```

This line explains the main scenario sequence is going to perform ```cook``` with
 arguments and then perform another ```eat``` action again. 

## Execution report
Following will be output during test case execution.
According to the line 5, 2 scenarios are going to be executed in this sequence, 
```cook(pasta,sauce)``` and ```eat```.

```

     5:Starting(primary#main):ScenarioSequence:[COOKED#cook(spaghetti,peperoncino),COOKED#eat()]
     6:  Running(primary#main):COOKED#cook(spaghetti,peperoncino) expecting status of 'primary' is 'COOKED' and a string starting with "Cooking" is returned
     7:  Passed(primary#main)
     8:  Running(primary#main):COOKED#eat() expecting status of 'primary' is 'COOKED' and a string containing "yummy" is returned
     9:  Passed(primary#main)
    10:End(primary#main)
    
```

line 6 and 6 shows what FSM/JCUnit is going to do and what it is expecting as a 
result of those scenarios.

Pick up line 6.

```

     6:  Running(primary#main):COOKED#cook(spaghetti,peperoncino) expecting \ 
             status of 'primary' is 'COOKED' and a string starting with "Cooking" is returned
```

It is almost what it is.
FSM/JCUnit is going to run a scenario ```cook``` with arguments ```spaghetti``` and 
```peperoncino```. And it expects that the SUT remains ```COOKED``` state and the
method returns a string that starts with ```Cooking```.

If the SUT's behaviour doesn't meet this expectation we will receive following output.

```

    Starting(primary#main):ScenarioSequence:[I#cook(spaghetti,peperoncino)]
      Running(primary#main):I#cook(spaghetti,peperoncino) expecting status of 'primary' is 'COOKED' and a string starting with "Cooking" is returned
      Failed(primary#main): Expectation was not satisfied: ['a string starting with "Cooking"' is expected to be returned but 'Creating spaghetti peperontino' was returned.]
    End(primary#main)

    com.github.dakusui.jcunit.fsm.Expectation$Result: Expectation was not satisfied: ['a string starting with "Cooking"' is expected to be returned but 'Creating spaghettini carbonara' was returned.]
        at com.github.dakusui.jcunit.fsm.Expectation$Result.throwIfFailed(Expectation.java:235)
        at com.github.dakusui.jcunit.fsm.ScenarioSequence$Base.perform(ScenarioSequence.java:184)
        at com.github.dakusui.jcunit.fsm.Story.perform(Story.java:26)
```

As you can see, the message is self-descriptive.

```

      Failed(primary#main): Expectation was not satisfied: \ 
          ['a string starting with "Cooking"' is expected to be returned but 'Creating spaghetti peperoncino' was returned.]

```

In this case, in spite that we are expecting a string which starts with "Cooking", 
but the returned one was starting with "Creating". 

In case a state error is detected, the message will be like this

```

    [FSM 'primary' is expected to be in 'COOKED' state but not.(actual='FlyingSpaghettiMonster@1197515375(false)')]

```

The portion ```actual='FlyingSpaghettiMonster@1197515375(false)'``` is printed by
```toString``` method. So it is a good idea to override ```toString``` method in your
SUT to return a string that represents the object's internal state.

# Inside FSM/JCUnit
In this section, following technical details will be discussed.

* Story/ScenarioSequence/Scenario
* Internal FSM factors

## Story/ScenarioSequence/Scenario
```Story<SUT, SPEC>``` is a class that holds a path an FSM should pass through in a
test case, generated by FSM/JCUnit.
```Story``` has two ```ScenarioSequences```, one of which is ```setUp``` and the
other is ```main```.
```main``` one is a part of a test case, which may start with a different state from
 ```I```. ```setUp``` describes a procedure to reach the state with which the 
 ```main``` scenario sequence belonging to the same story.

Both of them are instances of class ```ScenarioSequence```.

A ```ScenarioSequence``` object is, as its name suggests, a sequence of scenarios.
Then what a ```Scenario``` object needs to be answered. It is an object which 
comprises 3 members, ```State``` given, ```Action``` when, and ```Args``` with.

A ```State``` object represents a state the SUT's FSM should be in before the scenario
is performed. 

Following is a class diagram that illustrates relationships between those classes.

[FIG.3] "Class diagram for Story/ScenarioSequence/Scenario"
```

                      +----------------+       +--------------+
          setUp +---->|ScenarioSequence|<>---->|Scenario      |
                |    1+----------------+       +--------------+
                |
                |
    +-----+     |
    |Story|<>---+
    +-----+ 1   |                              
                |                              +--------------+
                |                              |Scenario      |
                |     +----------------+       +--------------+
           main +---->|ScenarioSequence|<>---->|State   given |
                     1+----------------+ 1   * |Action  when  |
                                               |Args    with  |
                                               +--------------+
    
```

When a ```ScenarioSequence``` is performed, it executes each scenario which 
belongs to the sequence one by one from the first one to the last. And when 
a scenario is executed, it figures out the status to which the FSM moves after
 a ```when``` action is executed with ```with``` arguments. Then it actually
 executes a method in SUT whose name is the same as the ```when``` action's.
The name of ```when``` action is derived from the spec class we discussed in the
previous section.

Also as discussed in the previous section,

```java

    @Test
    public void test() {
      FSMonster sut = new FSMonster();
      FSMUtils.performStory(this, "main", sut);
    }

```
 
 

Following is an excerpt from [CODE.2](#CODE.2).

```java

      @ActionSpec public Expectation<FSMonster> cook(Expectation.Builder<FSMonster> b) {
        ... }
```

When FSM/JCUnit finds this declaration, it assumes that there is a method whose
name is ```cook``` without any arguments in the SUT (i.e., ```FSMonster```) and
the method will be called during test executions.

If the method has 1 or more parameters, the action definition would look like following,

```java

      @ActionSpec 
      public Expectation<FSMonster> cook(Expectation.Builder<FSMonster> b, String dish) {
        ... }
```

This can be handled by FSM/JCUnit appropriately. JCUnit looks up a method whose name
is ```cook``` and its only argument's type is ```String```.
 
But you are not able to test 2 overloading methods at once. If you are going to
do it, action definitions will look like following, which would work.

```java

      @ActionSpec 
      public Expectation<FSMonster> cook(Expectation.Builder<FSMonster> b, String dish) {
        ... }

      @ActionSpec 
      public Expectation<FSMonster> cook(Expectation.Builder<FSMonster> b, String pasta, String sauce) {
        ... }

```

### Overloading a method
But how can we give parameters to them? Based on what we have discussed, the parameters 
definitions would look like this,

  
```java

      @ParametersSpec
      public static final Parameters cook = new Parameters.Builder(new Object[][] {
          { "spaghetti", "spaghettini", "penne" },
          { "peperoncino", "carbonara", "meat sauce" },
      }).build();

      @ParametersSpec
      public static final Parameters cook = new Parameters(new Object[][] {
          { "soup", "primo", "dolce" }
      }).build();
```

But this results in a compilation error because a Java class can only have one field
with a certain name.

To model an overloading method like this one, you need to define a field with a different 
name and refer to it from a method in your model using ```parametersSpec``` attribute.

```java

      @ParametersSpec
      public static final Parameters cook = new Parameters(new Object[][] {
          { "soup", "primo", "dolce" }
      }).build();

      @ActionSpec(parametersSpec="cook1") 
      public Expectation<FSMonster> cook(Expectation.Builder<FSMonster> b, String dish) {
        ... }

      @ParametersSpec
      public static final Parameters cook = new Parameters.Builder(new Object[][] {
          { "spaghetti", "spaghettini", "penne" },
          { "peperoncino", "carbonara", "meat sauce" },
      }).build();
      
      @ActionSpec
      public Expectation<FSMonster> cook(Expectation.Builder<FSMonster> b, String dish) {
        ... }

```

## Internal FSM factors
Suppose your FSM has 3 states and 4 actions. And it's named "myfsm".
And you have configured your test class that the number of switches is 1.
FSM/JCUnit will create following factors internally.

[FIG.4] "State machine for example of FSM factor expansion"
```

          pay         drink
      +---------+  +-----------+
      |         |  |           |
      V         |  V           |
    +---+      +----+        +----+
    | I |----->| S0 |------->| S1 |
    +---+ cook +----+eat     +----+
      |                        A
      |                        |
      +------------------------+
                drink/1

```

And following  is a list of definitions of methods mentioned in the previous diagram.
Values that a tester want to use in tests as arguments of each method are
 given in comments.

```java

    public void drink(String beverage)  // beverage can be "tea" or "coffee"
    public void eat(int number)         // silver can be 1 or 2
    public void cook(String pasta, String sauce)
                                        // pasta can be "spaghetti", "spaghettini", or "penne"
                                        // sauce can be "peperoncino", "meat sauce", or "carbonara"
    public void pay(int money)          // money can be 1, 10, or 30.

```

A state machine defined above will be translated into a set of factors, shown in 
a following matrix, by FSM/JCUnit. 

| Factor               | Levels                                                          |
| -------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FSM:myfsm:state:0    | I, S0, S1                                                       |
| FSM:myfsm:action:0   | cook, drink, eat, pay                                           |
| FSM:myfsm:param:0:0  | 1, 10, 30, "spaghetti", ..., 2, "tea", "coffee", or VOID        |
| FSM:myfsm:param:0:1  | "peperoncino","meat sauce", "carbonara", VOID                   |
| FSM:myfsm:state:1    | I, S0, S1, VOID                                                 |
| FSM:myfsm:action:1   | cook, drink, eat, pay, VOID                                     |
| FSM:myfsm:param:1:0  | (see above)                                                     |
| FSM:myfsm:param:1:1  | (see above)                                                     |

Note that ```FSM:myfsm:param:0:0:``` is a union of first arguments of ```drink```, 
```eat```, ```cook```, and ```pay```. And even if the values are overlapping, 
they are not listed twice. That is, ```1``` is a possible first argument for ```eat```
and ```pay```, it appears in the factor only once, though.  
After FSM states, actions, and parameters are expanded to those factors, JCUnit
 will generate test cases.
 During this generation, ```FSMConstraintManager``` checks if each test case
matches requirements given by the FSM, e.g., "If 'FSM:myfsm:state:0' is ```S0```
and 'FSM:myfsm:action:0' is 'pay', this test case must be wrong" (actual checking
 procedure is slightly more complicated than this, because FSM/JCUnit tries to
 generate test cases which tests if SUT gives an appropriate exception).

# Tips
In this section, some useful tips for FSM/JCUnit in real usages. 

## Nested FSM
In real world, things are nested. In FSMs it is so, too. An object with states has 
a ```createXyz``` method. And then the returned object by the method has its own 
states, too.

FSM/JCUnit supports this sort of structure. Suppose that we are going to test
an FSM that creates another one, and we want to test both of them.
[FIG.5] shows an example for this situation.


[FIG.5] "Nested FSM"
```

    primary FSM
                                +--+
                                |  |eat 
                                |  V 
    +-----+                   +------+
    |  I  |------------------>|COOKED|
    +-----+ cook(pasta,sauce) +------+
                                |  A
                                |  |cook(pasta,sauce): nested FSM
                                +--+
    nested FSM
   

     +---+
     |   |toString
     |   V
    +-----+
    |  I  |
    +-----+

```

In order to implement tests for these FSM, things to be done are described in [CODE.6].

[CODE.6] "Nested FSM example"
```java

    /**
     * Spec of parent FSM. This create a child FSM to be tested when cook method
     * is called on COOKED state.
     */
    public enum Spec implements FSMSpec<FSMonster> {
      @StateSpec I {
        ...
      },
      @StateSpec COOKED {
        ...
        @Override
        public Expectation<FSMonster> cook(Expectation.Builder<FSMonster> b, String dish, String sauce) {
          ////
          //  (*) Building an Expectation object for nested FSM. 
          return b.valid(this, new Expectation.Checker.FSM("nested")).build();
        }        
      }


    /**
     * Spec of nested FSM, in this case a string, which is immutable and its
     * spec as FSM is trivial.
     */
    public enum NestedSpec implements FSMSpec<String> {
      ...
    }

    @FactorField(levelsProvider = FSMLevelsProvider.class)
    public Story<FlyingSpaghettiMonster, Spec> primary;
    
    @FactorField(levelsProvider = FSMLevelsProvider.class)
    public Story<String, NestedSpec> nested;
    
    @Test
    public void test1() {
      FSMonster sut = new FSMonster();
      FSMUtils.performStory(this, "primary", sut, new ScenarioSequence.Observer.Factory.ForSilent());
    }

```

The line commented "(*) Building an Expectation object for nested FSM" is the trick.
By doing this, you are able to let FSM/JCUnit know the returned expectation is
for another FSM. And the argument ```"nested"``` is a name of the ```Story``` field 
you want to let FSM/JCUnit perform.

If a user creates a cyclic link, what will happen?
Don't worry ```FSMUtils.performStory``` executes a story at most once by checking 
```Story``` object's state.

And as usual, you can now perform the story by doing ```test1()```.

But it might be a good idea to do following because, as it is mentioned, ```FSMUtils.performStory```
method tries 'at most' once each story. It means that if the story doesn't execute
```cook``` method on ```COOKED``` state, the nested FSM will not be tested in the
test case.


```java

      @Test
      public void test2() {
        FSMonster sut = new FSMonster();
        FSMUtils.performStory(this, "primary", sut);
        if (!this.nested.isPerformed()) {
          FSMUtils.performStory(this, "nested", "Cooking spaghetti meat sauce");
        }
      }
```

Working example is found [here](https://github.com/dakusui/jcunit/tree/develop/src/test/java/com/github/dakusui/jcunit/examples/fsm/nested/NestedFSMTest.java).

## SUT adapter
FSM/JCUnit requires almost not 'adapter' implementation work, but you can do it 
if you want.

What you need to do is simple.

+ Create an adapter class. Let's call  it ```MyAdapter```, here. 
+ Model your SUT by implementing ```FSMSpec<MyAdapter>``` as in normal use cases of 
  FSM/JCUnit. Let's call the model ```MySpec``` here.[CODE.7]
+ Implement all the methods annotated with ```@ActionSpec``` so that they operate 
  actual SUT (but exclude the first parameter ```Expectation.Builder<MyAdapter>``` 
  from the parameters).[CODE.8]
+ Consider implementing ```check(MyAdapter)``` method in ```MySpec``` class by
  delegating to ```MyAdapter#check(MySpec)```.

Inside ```MyAdapter``` you can do whatever you want. You can use Selenium to 
manipulate GUI, issue CLI commands, HTTP requests, etc.
Another benefit of this approach is that you will have a good Java wrapper API to 
access your SUT which can be re-used for other purposes like creating admin utilities, 
value added services on top of your SUT, etc.

[CODE.7] "Spec example"
```java

    public enum MySpec {
      @StateSpec I {
      },
      @StateSpec ... {
      }
      @ActionSpec public Expectation<MyAdapter> initialize(Expectation.Builder<MyAdapter> b) { ... }
      @ActionSpec public Expectation<MyAdapter> perform(Expectation.Builder<MyAdapter> b) { ... }
      @ActionSpec public Expectation<MyAdapter> print(Expectation.Builder<MyAdapter> b, PrintStream ps) { ... }
      @ActionSpec public Expectation<MyAdapter> toString(Expectation.Builder<MyAdapter> b) { ... }
      
      public boolean check(MyAdapter myAdapter) {
        return myAdapter.check(this);
      }
    }
    
```

[CODE.8] "An adapter"
```java

    public class MyAdapter {
      public void initialize() {
        ...
      }
      
      public void perform() {
        ...
      }
      
      public void print(PrintStream ps) {
        ...
      }
      
      public String toString() {
        ...
      }
      
      public boolean check(MySpec spec) {
          return ...;
      }
    }
```

## Offline testing
Doing offline testing with FSM/JCUnit is simple.
You have already had a test case in your test object as ```@FactorField``` annotated 
fields (```fsm1``` and ```fsm2``` in this example). Keep them and use them later.

```java

    @RunWith(JCUnit.class)
    public class DoubleFSMTest {
      @FactorField(levelsProvider = FSMLevelsProvider.class)
      public Story<Turnstile, TurnstileTest.Spec> fsm1;
    
      @FactorField(levelsProvider = FSMLevelsProvider.class)
      public Story<Turnstile, TurnstileTest.Spec> fsm2;
```

Probably it is a good idea to separate the class into two (or more if necessary), one of
which is for generating test suite and the other is for later execution (see the example 
below).


```java

    @RunWith(JCUnit.class)
    public abstract class DoubleFSMTestBase {
      @FactorField(levelsProvider = FSMLevelsProvider.class)
      public Story<Turnstile, TurnstileTest.Spe> fsm1;
    
      @FactorField(levelsProvider = FSMLevelsProvider.class)
      public Story<Turnstile, TurnstileTest.Spec> fsm2;

    }
    
    public class DoubleFSMTestGenerator extends DoubleFSMTestBase {
        @Rule
        public               Recorder recorder      = new Recorder();
        ...
    }
  
    @TupleGeneration(
        generator = @Generator(
            value = Replayer.class,
            params = {
                @Param("FailedOnly"),
                @Param("src/test/resources")
            }
        )
    )
    public class DoubleFSMTestExecutor extends DoubleFSMTestBase {
        public void testFSMs() {
          ...
        }
    }
    
```

You can refer to following files for how ```Recorder``` and ```Replayer``` work.

* [Recorder.java](https://github.com/dakusui/jcunit/tree/develop/src/test/java/com/github/dakusui/jcunit/core/rules/Recorder.java)
* [Replayer.java](https://github.com/dakusui/jcunit/tree/develop/src/test/java/com/github/dakusui/jcunit/generators/Replayer.java)

## Multi-threads

Suppose that you are given 2 (or more) FSM and you need to make sure they can work
concurrently without defects.

```java

    @RunWith(JCUnit.class)
    public class ConcurrentTurnstileTest {
      @FactorField(levelsProvider = FSMLevelsProvider.class)
      public Story<Turnstile, Spec> t1;
      @FactorField(levelsProvider = FSMLevelsProvider.class)
      public Story<Turnstile, Spec> t2;
    
      @Test(timeout = 100)
      public void test1() {
        FSMUtils.performStoriesConcurrently(
            this,
            new Story.Request.ArrayBuilder()
                .add("t1", new Turnstile())
                .add("t2", new Turnstile())
                .build()
        );
      }
    }
```

In order to test a ```Turnstile``` object is thread-safe, you can do try following
code fragment.

```java


      @Test(timeout = 100)
      public void test1() {
        Turnstile turnstile = new Turnstile();
        FSMUtils.performStoriesConcurrently(
            this,
            new Story.Request.ArrayBuilder()
                .add("t1", turnstile)           // The same object is manipulated by 2
                .add("t2", turnstile)           // threads concurrently.
                .build()
        );
      }
```

This test will fail miserably because a turnstile isn't thread-safe generally speaking.

Inside the method, FSMUtils.performStoriesConcurrently, scenarios that belong to main 
scenario sequences of those multiple FSMs' actions are invoked in 'synchronized' way.

The first scenarios of the sequences are executed at the same time, and the next scenarios
will not be executed until all scenarios finish. Once all the first scenario have
finished, the second ones will be executed in a same manner, etc.

Factors are organized like a matrix below when test suite is generated internally,

| Factor            | Levels                                               |
| ----------------- |:---------------------------------------------------- |
| FSM:t1:state:0    | I, LOCKED                                            |
| FSM:t1:action:0   | coin, pass                                           |
| FSM:t1:state:1    | I, LOCKED                                            |
| FSM:t1:action:1   | coin, pass                                           |
| FSM:t2:state:0    | I, LOCKED                                            |
| FSM:t2:action:0   | coin, pass                                           |
| FSM:t2:state:1    | I, LOCKED                                            |
| FSM:t2:action:1   | coin, pass                                           |

 If we apply a pairwise test suite generation to this factor space, all the combinations
between t1's states and t2's states will be tested, t1's first action and t2's first 
action, etc. But does number of test cases become 256? No just 4. This is because
the turnstile's model limits possible transitions and also because pairwise technique. 

Thus, we are able to test possible combinations with a reasonably good coverage and
  small amount of test cases.
