= The JCUnit: Test Design as Code

image:{javadoc-basedir}/resources/images/JCunit-logo-compact.png[The JCUnit] is the key-product to implement the concept of "Test Design as Code", where automated tests are implemented and executed under the same practice as the product code side.
The "same practice" means removing extra efforts which are required only fo the testing code when you write automated test using JCUnit.
For instance, you always keep repeating a similar method multiple times in order just to cover combinations of values, but D-R-Y (Don't repeat yourself) is a basic principle of writing a product code.
JCUnit allows you to write it once, and it automatically comes up with a set of small combinations of test input parameter values to ensure good coverage over the system under test (SUT).
