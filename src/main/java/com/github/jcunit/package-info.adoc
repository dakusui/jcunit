The *JCUnitX* is the tenth generation of the JCUnit.

It is designed under the following philosophy.

1. Let the programmers (SET, SDET, SWET) model their test suite, not the SUT, using a general purpose programming language.
Remember, a general purpose programming language has always more powerful modeling capability than any GUI-based modeling tools out of the box.
What we need is :
* Provide a programming model on which the programmers can build their own test models as code, which represent
  ** Their understanding about the SUT.
  ** How the test suite should be generated from the model such as in what strength (combinatorial coverage) it should be, or each choice coverage is sufficient, etc.
*  Try to hide implementation details from the user programmers.


2. Employ the techniques developed under "combinatorial interaction testings" to generate test input data.
This allows us to prevent test suites from becoming too big to manage.
That's why we have *C* in *JCUnitX*!

3. The programming model must allow programmers to define the model over SUT without any repetitions.
That is, the programmers can do "D-R-Y" (don't repeat yourself), and their artifacts for tests can be written as clean as the product code.
